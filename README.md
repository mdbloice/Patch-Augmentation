# Patch Augmentation
*Patch Augmentation* is an image augmentation technique designed to improve model generalisation and mitigate adversarial attacks.

## How it works

Patch Augmentation is a simple method where new, augmented images are created by combining two images from two different classes to create a new image and label pair.

A notebook containing a reproducible experiment (using ResNetv1 and ResNetv2 on the CIFAR10 dataset) can be found in the following notebook:

## Examples

Below some examples are to appear to highlight its functionality.
